## Inspiration

### Wispr-Flow
This project was inspired by Wispr-Flow, a commercial voice-to-text application for macOS. While Wispr-Flow is a polished, paid product with cloud capabilities, this clone aims to provide similar core functionality for Ubuntu users who prefer:
- 100% local processing
- Open-source implementation
- No subscription fees
- Full privacy and control

## Development

**Architecture & Implementation**: Factory AI Assistant
**Design Philosophy**: Modular, maintainable, privacy-first
**Code Standards**: <300 lines per file, type hints, comprehensive documentation

## Community

This is an educational and personal-use project demonstrating:
- Local speech recognition
- System-level integration on Linux
- Modern Python best practices
- Privacy-first software design
