# Quick Start Guide - Wispr-Flow Clone

Get up and running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites

You need Ubuntu 20.04+ with X11. This application does **not** work on headless servers without a display.

## Step 1: Install System Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y xdotool portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio python3-venv
```

## Step 2: Setup Project

If you need to set up the project:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/projects/wispr-flow-clone

# Virtual environment is already created
# Dependencies are already installed
```

## Step 3: Verify Setup

Run the verification script:

```bash
./verify_setup.py
```

You should see all checks pass with ‚úì marks.

## Step 4: Run the Application

```bash
./run.sh
```

Or directly:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m src.main
```

## Step 5: Use It!

1. **The application is now listening for your hotkey**
2. **Press and HOLD Ctrl+Alt** (both keys together)
3. **Speak clearly** while holding the keys
4. **Release the keys** when done speaking
5. **Your speech will be transcribed** where your cursor is

## Example Usage

1. Open any text editor (gedit, vim, VS Code, etc.)
2. Click in a text field
3. Hold Ctrl+Alt
4. Say: "Hello world, this is a test of the voice transcription system"
5. Release Ctrl+Alt
6. The text appears where your cursor was!

## First Run Notes

### Model Download
On the first run, Whisper will download the model (200MB-3GB depending on size). This is one-time and takes a few minutes.

### Audio Warnings
You may see ALSA warnings like:
```
ALSA lib pcm_dsnoop.c:567:(snd_pcm_dsnoop_open) unable to open slave
```

These are normal and can be ignored. The application will still work.

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:

### Change Hotkey
```yaml
hotkey:
  modifiers: ["ctrl", "shift"]  # Use Ctrl+Shift instead
  key: ""
```

### Use Different Model Size
```yaml
model:
  size: "small"  # Options: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v3
```

### Enable GPU (if you have NVIDIA GPU)
```yaml
model:
  device: "cuda"  # Much faster!
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'faster_whisper'"
```bash
cd ~/projects/wispr-flow-clone
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "xdotool not found"
```bash
sudo apt install xdotool
```

### Hotkey Not Working
- Ensure you're on X11 (not Wayland)
- Check if another application is using the same hotkey
- Try a different key combination in `config.yaml`

### Slow Transcription
- Use a smaller model: `model.size: "tiny"` or `"base"`
- Enable GPU if available: `model.device: "cuda"`

### No Audio Input
```bash
# List audio devices
.venv/bin/python verify_setup.py
```

Then set the device index in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
audio:
  device_index: 4  # Use the device number from the list
```

## Stopping the Application

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal to stop.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Speak clearly** and at a normal pace
2. **Use a good microphone** for better accuracy
3. **Minimize background noise**
4. **Wait a moment** after releasing the keys for transcription
5. **Start with short phrases** to test, then try longer sentences

## What's Happening Behind the Scenes

1. You press Ctrl+Alt ‚Üí Audio recording starts
2. You speak ‚Üí Audio is captured in memory
3. You release keys ‚Üí Recording stops
4. Audio is transcribed using Whisper (locally, no internet needed!)
5. Text is injected at cursor position using xdotool

## Next Steps

- Read the full [README.md](README.md) for detailed documentation
- Adjust `config.yaml` for your preferences
- Try different model sizes to balance speed and accuracy
- Consider enabling GPU acceleration for real-time performance

## Privacy Note

**Everything runs locally on your machine.** Your voice never leaves your computer. No internet connection required (except for the initial model download).
