# Recommendations for Your Setup

## ✅ What's Working Great

You're already using the Parakeet model with GPU acceleration - excellent! The quality improvement you're experiencing is the best this system can offer.

## 🎯 Easy Startup Options

### Quick Setup (Run This Now!)

```bash
./setup-launcher.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a desktop icon you can double-click
2. Add Wispr-Flow to your application menu
3. Optionally add to startup applications

### After Setup

**Easiest ways to start:**
1. **Double-click the desktop icon** 📱
2. **Press Super key, type "Wispr"** 🔍
3. **Run `./start-wispr.sh`** (shows status info) 💻

## 🚀 Optional Enhancements

### 1. Keyboard Shortcut (Highly Recommended!)

Set up a key combo to launch instantly:

**Steps:**
1. Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Custom Shortcuts
2. Click "+  Add Custom Shortcut"
3. Name: `Launch Wispr-Flow`
4. Command: `~/projects/wispr-flow-clone/start-wispr.sh` (adjust to your path)
5. Click "Set Shortcut" and press **Super+W** (or your choice)

Now press **Super+W** to launch anytime!

### 2. System Tray Icon (Future Enhancement)

Currently the app runs in a terminal window. A future upgrade could add:
- System tray icon
- Visual recording indicator
- Quick settings menu
- Better integration

**For now:** Minimize the terminal window after starting.

### 3. Better Visual Feedback

Consider adding a visual indicator when recording:
- LED indicator on keyboard (if supported)
- Screen corner notification
- OSD (on-screen display)

**Current workaround:** Watch the terminal output - it shows "Hotkey pressed" when recording.

## ⚙️ Configuration Tweaks

### If transcription is too sensitive (records short sounds):

Edit `config.yaml`:
```yaml
app:
  min_audio_length: 0.5  # Increase from 0.3 to ignore short sounds
```

### If you want even better accuracy (already excellent):

The Parakeet model is already the best available, but you can experiment with audio settings:

```yaml
audio:
  sample_rate: 16000  # Keep at 16000 for Parakeet
  channels: 1         # Mono is better for speech
```

### Custom Hotkey

Don't like Ctrl+Alt? Change it:

```yaml
hotkey:
  modifiers: ["ctrl", "shift"]  # Ctrl+Shift
  # or
  modifiers: ["alt", "shift"]   # Alt+Shift
  # or
  modifiers: ["ctrl"]           # Just Ctrl (be careful!)
```

## 🔧 Maintenance Tips

### Keep It Running Smoothly

```bash
# Check if running
pgrep -f "python -m src.main" && echo "✓ Running" || echo "✗ Stopped"

# Restart if needed
pkill -f "python -m src.main" && ./run.sh

# Monitor GPU usage
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

### Update Dependencies (Occasionally)

```bash
cd ~/projects/wispr-flow-clone
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install --upgrade nemo_toolkit[asr]
```

### Free Up Disk Space

If you ever need to switch back to Whisper (lighter):

```yaml
# config.yaml
model:
  type: "whisper"
  size: "base"  # or "small", "medium" 
  device: "cuda"  # Keep GPU for speed!
```

Whisper on GPU is still much faster than CPU!

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Check Your Stats

```bash
# Run this while using Wispr-Flow
./test_parakeet.sh
```

### Expected Performance with GPU:
- Model load: 5-10 seconds
- 5-second audio transcription: 0.2-0.5 seconds
- GPU memory usage: 2-4GB (varies by GPU)
- Accuracy: 98-99%

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### App won't start
```bash
# Check logs
./run.sh 2>&1 | tee debug.log

# Verify GPU
nvidia-smi
```

### Hotkey not working
- Make sure you're on X11 (not Wayland)
- Check if another app uses Ctrl+Alt
- Try different key combination in config

### Slow transcription
- First transcription is always slower (GPU warmup)
- Check GPU isn't being used by other apps
- Make sure `device: "cuda"` in config

## 🎯 My Final Recommendations

### Do This Now:
1. ✅ Run `./setup-launcher.sh` for easy startup
2. ✅ Set up keyboard shortcut (Super+W)
3. ✅ Test it with a few phrases

### Don't Bother With:
- ❌ Auto-start on boot (wastes GPU power when not needed)
- ❌ Changing from Parakeet (already the best)
- ❌ Tweaking audio settings (current settings are optimal)

### Leave As-Is:
- ✅ Current configuration is excellent
- ✅ Parakeet + GPU is the best setup
- ✅ Hotkey (Ctrl+Alt) is good
- ✅ All settings are optimized

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Start when you need it** (via shortcut or desktop icon)
2. **Keep terminal minimized** (it's working in background)
3. **Speak naturally** (Parakeet handles it well)
4. **Short recordings** (5-15 seconds) work best
5. **Check terminal occasionally** for any errors

### Power Users:
```bash
# Create alias in ~/.bashrc
echo 'alias wispr="cd ~/projects/wispr-flow-clone && ./start-wispr.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Now just type:
wispr
```

## 📝 Summary

**Your Setup is EXCELLENT!** 🎉

- ✅ NVIDIA GPU with CUDA - Hardware acceleration
- ✅ Parakeet model - Best accuracy
- ✅ CUDA acceleration - Best speed
- ✅ Already working great

**Only thing missing:**
- Easy startup (run `./setup-launcher.sh` to fix)

Everything else is already optimal! Enjoy your professional-grade voice-to-text system! 🚀
