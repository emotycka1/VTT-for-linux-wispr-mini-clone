## 🚀 Easy Startup for Next Time

### Want to Click an Icon to Start?

**Run this once:**
```bash
cd ~/projects/wispr-flow-clone
./setup-launcher.sh
```

This creates a **desktop icon** you can double-click to start!

### Want a Keyboard Shortcut? (Recommended!)

**Create a shortcut to launch with one key combo:**

1. Open **Settings** → **Keyboard** → **View and Customize Shortcuts** → **Custom Shortcuts**
2. Click **+ Add Shortcut** (or **+ Add**)
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name:** `Launch Wispr-Flow`
   - **Command:** `~/projects/wispr-flow-clone/start-wispr.sh`
   - *(Adjust path if your project is in a different location)*
4. Click **Set Shortcut** button
5. When the dialog appears, **press the keys you want:**
   - Press **Super+W** (Windows key + W)
   - Or choose your own combination (like **Ctrl+Alt+W**)
6. Click **Add** to save

**Now press your chosen keys (e.g., Super+W) anytime to launch!** 🎯

*Note: The "Super" key is the Windows logo key (⊞) on your keyboard*

## 💡 What Else to Do?

### Recommendation: **Nothing! It's perfect as-is!**

You have:
- ✅ Best model (Parakeet)
- ✅ GPU accelerated (NVIDIA CUDA)
- ✅ Best performance optimization
- ✅ Already working and running

### Only Add:

**1. Desktop Launcher** (1 minute)
```bash
./setup-launcher.sh
```

**2. Keyboard Shortcut** (2 minutes)
- Follow instructions above
- I recommend **Super+W**

That's it! Everything else is already optimal.
