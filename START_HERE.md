## 💡 What Else to Do?

### Recommendation: **Nothing! It's perfect as-is!**

You have:
- ✅ Best model (Parakeet)
- ✅ Best hardware (RTX 4090)
- ✅ Best performance (GPU accelerated)
- ✅ Already working and running

### Only Add:

**1. Desktop Launcher** (1 minute)
```bash
./setup-launcher.sh
```

**2. Keyboard Shortcut** (2 minutes)
- Follow instructions above
- I recommend **Super+W**

That's it! Everything else is already optimal.
